  name:  Snow Goose 
  latin: Anser caerulescens
  text:  "A very difficult species to categorise as only around 16 of the 47 records in Lancashire – the first which was on the mosses near Southport from October to December 1958 - are considered to relate to wild birds. The only 'recent' record further to the one present in 1996 (Birds of Marshside, McCarthy, 2000) was of a first-summer bird. It was first recorded at Seaforth in January and commuted between Marshside and Martin Mere MMWWT between May and December 2002. A feral flock of some 24 birds frequented south Lancashire including Marshside and Hesketh Out Marsh from late August 2016."

  name:   Ross's Goose 
  latin: Chen rossi
  text:  "This Category D species has never been accepted as occurring in the UK as a natural wild bird. A first winter, now adult, arrived at Marshside on November 11th 2013 and has been seen each winter since, usually arriving in late October and departing in early April. What is possibly 'our' bird arrived in the lowlands of SW Iceland on April 11th 2016 with large flocks of returning Pink-footed geese, after being previously seen in autumn 2013. It's recorded here for interest only and is not included in the checklist total of 257."

  name:  Barnacle Goose 
  latin: Branta leucopsis
  text:  "Most wild birds recorded in Lancashire originate from the high arctic Svalbard population, which winters on the Solway. Overshoots are regularly recorded in winter, although the situation is clouded by the presence of local feral breeding populations, such as the >75 birds resident and breeding at Knowsley Hall/ Safari Park and other feral flocks at Martin Mere Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (MMWWT) reserve."

  text:  "A first-winter bird was found at Fluke Hall on the Fylde on October 24th 2010 and was subsequently seen and photographed at Marshside on November 6th 2010, before moving on to MMWWT and various other sites. It was then present on the Fylde until January 31st 2011 and was accepted by the BBRC as the first wild record for Lancashire. A feral adult was also present at the same time, mostly at MMWWT reserve, but was in the company of feral Barnacles, whereas the 1st-winter bird was with wild Pink-footed Geese."
