  name:  Bewick's Swan
  latin: Cygnus columbianus bewickii
  text:  "Formerly a regular winter visitor with for example 330 recorded in January 1978. However, since the late 1980s it has become much less frequent, with a flock of 150 on Rimmer's Marsh (M1) in January 1998 the largest flock for some ten years. The last record for the reserve itself was of seven in January 2008."
-
  name:  Whooper Swan
  latin: Cygnus cygnus
  text:  "The larger Whooper Swan is now much more regular than its congener, with around 2,000 birds wintering at nearby Martin Mere (MMWWT) and on the Fylde. Small numbers occasionally frequent Crossens Out Marsh, such as 11 on 2nd April 2015. Any wild swans on the reserve are now noteworthy and the largest transient flock for some years was of 52 on the saltmarsh behind the former Sand Works compound on March 13th 2016."

  name:  Bean Goose
  latin: Anser fabalis
  text:  "An uncommon migrant accompanying Pink-footed Geese, both races of Bean Goose (Tundra _serrirostris_ and Taiga _fabalis_) are now increasingly uncommon, with Taiga Bean the more regular in Lancashire.

  name:  Pink-footed Goose
  latin: Anser brachyrhynchus
  text:  "The most abundant grey goose species in autumn and winter; their noisy arrival from Iceland in early September, signals the end of summer and the arrival of winter. 95,013 Pinkfeet were counted on co-ordinated counts in SW Lancashire in October 2015, of which the Marshside count was 20,377. Sizeable flocks of &gt;2,000 birds can still be seen on Crossens Out Marsh at the end of April until early May"

  name:  Snow Goose
  latin: Anser caerulescens
  text:  "A very difficult species to categorise as only around 16 of the 47 records in Lancashire -- the first which was on the mosses near Southport from October to December 1958 -- are considered to relate to wild birds. The only 'recent' record further to the one present in 1996 Birds of Marshside,_ McCarthy, 2000_ was of a first-summer bird. It was first recorded at Seaforth in January and commuted between Marshside and Martin Mere MMWWT between May and December 2002. A feral flock of some 24 birds frequented south Lancashire including Marshside and Hesketh Out Marsh from late August 2016."

  name:  Ross's Goose
  latin: Chen rossi
  text:  "This Category D species has never been accepted as occurring in the UK as a natural wild bird. A first winter, now adult, arrived at Marshside on November 11th 2013 and has been seen each winter since, usually arriving in late October and departing in early April. What is possibly 'our' bird arrived in the lowlands of SW Iceland on April 11th 2016 with large flocks of returning Pink-footed geese, after being previously seen in autumn 2013. It's recorded here for interest only and is not included in the checklist total of 257."

  name:  (Greater) Canada Goose
  latin: Branta canadensis
  text:  "Introduced into Lancashire in 1810, at Lord Derby's Knowsley Hall Estate, the Canada Goose population has exploded, becoming an alien 'pest'; species in some places. 16 pairs bred at Marshside in 2015 with several hundred birds present on the nearby SML post breeding and in winter as during the Ribble WeBS count in August 2013, when 473 were counted."

  name:  Lesser Canada (Cackling) Goose
  latin: Branta hutchinsii
  text:  "The first accepted record for Britain was eventually decided upon by the BOU in March 2016. The Plex Moss bird in November 1976 became the 601st species recorded in Britain; another seen from October 7th to 21st 2012 at MMWWT was at Marshside on October 25th 2012 (Colin Bushell). The record is still under consideration by the BBRC/BOU."

-
  name:  Barnacle Goose
  latin: Branta leucopsis
  text:  "Most wild birds recorded in Lancashire originate from the high arctic Svalbard population, which winters on the Solway. Overshoots are regularly recorded in winter, although the situation is clouded by the presence of local feral breeding populations, such as the &gt;75 birds resident and breeding at Knowsley Hall/ Safari Park and other feral flocks at Martin Mere Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (MMWWT) reserve."
-
  name:  Brent Goose
  latin: Branta bernicla
  text:  "Both pale (_hrota_) and dark-bellied (_bernicla_) races occur, with usually only one/two records per year. The dark-bellied race is more frequent in Lancashire with small wintering flocks regularly present on the Fylde coast at Pilling Lane Ends."

  latin: Branta ruficollis
  text:  "A first-winter bird was found at Fluke Hall on the Fylde on October 24th 2010 and was subsequently seen and photographed at Marshside on November 6th 2010, before moving on to MMWWT and various other sites. It was then present on the Fylde until January 31st 2011 and was accepted by the BBRC as the first wild record for Lancashire. A feral adult was also present at the same time, mostly at MMWWT reserve, but was in the company of feral Barnacles, whereas the 1st-winter bird was with wild Pink-footed Geese."

  name:  Shelduck
  latin: Tadorna tadorna
  text:  "Ten pairs bred in 2015 and 5,415 were recorded on the Ribble WeBS count in November the same year. The adults are too large to be preyed upon by most raptors, but one young bird was drowned and then very messily eaten by a Great Black-backed Gull in front of Sandgrounders Hide in winter 2015."

  name:  Wigeon
  latin: Anas penelope
  text:  "The Ribble Estuary is the most important site in the UK for wintering Wigeon, with 34,367 counted on the Ribble WeBS count in December 2015. A significant proportion of these birds frequent Rimmer's Marsh (formerly M1) &amp; Sutton's Marsh (formerly M2) and the adjacent salt marshes. Small numbers over-summer in most years, as dis a pair in 2016, but there has been no evidence of breeding."
-
  name:  American Wigeon
  latin: Anas americana
  text:  "The first record was of a pair between April 24th and May 6th 1996, although as always the identification of the duck is problematical. Since then there have been seven further records between October and June, all drakes. The most recent record is of another drake, seen intermittently with Eurasian Wigeon on Crossens Out Marsh and other locations, since October 5th 2016."
-
  name:  Gadwall
  latin: Anas strepera
  text:  "A very healthy 18 pairs nested in 2015 with 50 recorded at Marshside on the December WeBS count in the same year. This has not always been the case. The first record was in April 1980 and the first breeding was not confirmed until 1995, when three pairs nested."
-
  name:  Baikal Teal
  latin: Anas formosa
  text:  "Only the 6th UK record and not surprisingly the first for Lancashire involved a well watched drake amongst the flocks of Eurasian Teal, adjacent to Crossens Sluice and Crossens Inner Marsh, between November 30th – December 11th 2013."
-
  name:  Eurasian Teal
  latin: Anas crecca
  text:  "The second most numerous duck after Wigeon in winter, with 5,089 counted on the Ribble Estuary WeBS in January 2015. Two to four pairs have bred in recent years, but like most wintering wildfowl in the UK, numbers are gradually declining."

  name:  Pintail
  latin: Anas acuta
  text:  "With a maximum 1481 on the Ribble WeBS count in January 2015, numbers of this handsome duck have also declined significantly from its former winter abundance; for example, 4,700 were present in December 1984. Sometimes a drake or a pair over-summers."
-
  name:  Garganey
  latin: Anas querquedula
  text:  "The return of our only migrant breeding duck is eagerly awaited from early April onwards, with the earliest recorded on March 13th 1977. Records have become more regular in the last decade, with multiple sightings of up to four drakes in May and early June, usually on Rimmer's Marsh. In late May 1992, a nest with at least six eggs was discovered and it's likely that breeding is at least attempted in most years. At dusk on Friday July 1st 2016, a duck with nine ducklings swam out to feed on Rimmer's Marsh and were seen again two days later."

-
  name:  Pochard
  latin: Aythya farina
  text:  "Always uncommon, this diving duck prefers larger and deeper water bodies, such as SML, Martin Mere WWT and Leighton Moss. Another declining wintering species, the occurrence of small parties of two/three birds, usually on Rainford's lagoon, as in winter 2015/6, is now a noteworthy event. Formerly much more numerous, with 120 counted on the January 2008 Ribble WeBS survey for example."

-
  name:  Lesser Scaup
  latin: Aythya affinis
  text:  "A drake, which frequented Rainford'sLagoon from March 19th–April 23rd 2011 is the only record. It had been present for some days and was assumed to be a drake (Greater) Scaup, before being correctly identified by a more experienced, local birder."
-
  name:  Eider
  latin: Somateria mollissima
  text:  "Colonists from the large Morecambe Bay population, around a dozen pairs now nest on the south Ribble Marshes. Consequently high tide sightings of Eider from the former Sand Works compound (aka MBO) are now fairly regular."

  name:  Goosander
  latin: Mergus merganser
  text:  "Like the Red-breasted Merganser, theGoosander is only very rarely recorded, with only six verified sightings in the last 45 years. The last was of a drake on a small pond on Hesketh Golf Course on May 6th 2007, but as they are now breeding regularly on the Yarrow/Douglas, perhaps more sightings are likely."
-
  name:  Ruddy Duck
  latin: Oxyura jamaicensis
  text:  "Introduced at Slimbridge WWT from North America in the mid-1950s, the Ruddy Duck soon became an unwanted alien species, competing with the native European White-headed Duck and the subject of a determined eradication programme since the early 1990s, which appears to have been successful. The last breeding record was of two pairs in 2007 and the last ever record was of a female on Rainford's lagoon from April 5th–June 27th 2010. RIP."

  name:  Leach's Petrel
  latin: Oceanodroma leucorhoa
  text:  "Although a regularSeptember/October passage occurs south through the Irish Sea, gale force WNW winds are required for several days before they are driven close inshore and can be reasonably expected to be seen. One being blown into the Ribble in the Christmas Day gale of 2001 was most unexpected."

  latin: Egretta garzetta
  text:  "Prior to 2000, there were just eight records of some 11 individuals with the first on August 9th 1993. Since 2000, the population has exploded, so that currently up to 60 birds regularly roost on the islands in SML, where at least five pairs bred in 2016, producing a minimum seven young. It's now almost impossible to visit Marshside at any time of year without seeing this formerly scarce migrant to the reserve."

  name:  Hen Harrier
  latin: Circus cyaneus
  text:  "From the early 1990s it became apparent that numbers were seriously declining. Their current Marshside status is that of a scarce passage migrant and an uncommon winter visitor. Usually, only one or two ringtails now frequent the saltmarshes except for in the very cold spell in late 2010/early 2011, when up to four birds were present. Due to illegal persecution on their Bowland breeding moors, by driven grouse shooting interests, the days are gone when up to seven birds, including adult males, regularly roosted off the sand plant compound."

  name:  Montagu's Harrier
  latin: Circus pygargus
  text:  "Three records before 2000, with the first in July 1972 and only one since 2000. A male frequented Altcar, Martin Mere WWT and the Ribble marshes between May 18th – June 9th 2014 and was seen on Crossens Marsh at least once in this period."

  name:  Avocet
  latin: Recurvirostra avosetta
  text:  |
    _The Birds of Marshside_, Barry McCarthy, 2000, has but this one line entry for the Avocet:

    'One on Crossens Channel on 9 September 1972 is the only record.'

    How things have changed! They first bred in Lancashire at the Eric Morecambe complex near Leighton Moss in 2001 and in 2002 two pairs bred at Marshside for the first time, producing seven young. Their numbers exploded thereafter and the noisy and very aggressive Avocet is now a common breeding species with over 77 present in early May 2016 and some 28 pairs nesting. Return from their wintering quarters on the south coast or northern France is in mid February and they have usually all departed to their regular wintering sites by mid October.

  latin: Pluvialis squatarola
  text:  "The Ribble Estuary is the most important site in Lancashire for wintering and passage Grey Plovers. On the January 2014 WEBS survey 5,219 were recorded and high tides in late April and May often push numbers of glorious summer-plumaged birds close inshore. Very few are ever seen on the fresh marshes; return passage is from early August to late September, with only small numbers remaining throughout winter."

  name:  Ringed Plover
  latin: Charadrius hiaticula
  text:  "Often not present on recent Ribble WeBS counts from November to February, Ringed Plovers are declining as a winter visitor. Peak spring passage is at the end of April to mid May, with 1,567 counted on the May 2015 WeBS. Most, if not all of these birds are likely to be of the Icelandic 'northern tundra' race, which are shorter-legged and darker backed than our breeding birds. Autumn migrants are most noticeable in high-tide roosts at the end of the sand track in August–October. One or two pairs attempt to breed most years, usually in the area of the former Sand Plant."

  text:  "The second commonest breeding wader with 65 pairs producing 54 young in summer 2014. However, this does not compare with a maximum number of 210 pairs in both 1980 and 1993, indicating the scale of the breeding decline of this key species from the mid-1990s. Wintering numbers have also declined from historic peaks, such as the 25,000 average count on the Ribble Estuary in the early 1990s to 13,900 on the WeBS count in December 2015, of which 9,000 were counted at Marshside."

  name:  Black-tailed Godwit
  latin: Limosa limosa
  text:  "Since 2,000, the huge increase in the Icelandic breeding population has resulted in a three-fold increase in numbers wintering and over-summering at Marshside. 5,000 were counted on the reserve on the January 2014 WEBS count and a record 6,680 were counted on December 28th 2015. In the late 1990s, although already increasing, 4,300 in winter 1998 was considered an entirely exceptional total. Around 2/400 birds, presumably first years, over-summer and sudden influxes in March/April also indicate a passage of Icelandic–bound birds stopping over at Marshside."

  name:  Ruff
  latin: Calidris pugnax
  text:  |
    The pugnacious male Ruff and his smaller femalecounterpart, the Reeve, are something of a Marshside speciality and are well worth more detailed coverage Recorded in our area since at least the 16th century there can be little doubt that the Ruff has been a regular breeding bird on the Ribble marshes and its adjacent grazing marshes for centuries.

    As their breeding behaviour is unlike any other wader many current birders are confused as to their real breeding status. The larger, bizarrely plumaged males only seriously fight and display in 'leks' whenever the smaller and much less numerous female (Reeve) appears to watch the entertainment. Their display plumage is only to intimidate other males and the females generally don't actively select which male they will mate with. The black plumaged males dominate the rufous males, who in turn have superiority over the white plumaged birds. But it's not that simple. Some smaller male birds, called 'Faeders' assume female plumage -- their testes are twice the volume of normal Ruffs -- and they sneak in and impregnate a Reeve without attracting attention, although presumably they themselves can become the object of other males' desire. Other, less showy, 'satellite males' hang around on the periphery of the leks awaiting similar opportunities, when the principal actors exit stage right.

    The 'lowland' Ruff's optimal breeding habitat is grazing pasture, which is flooded in winter and then dry out in spring (aka Marshside) to expose bare areas on which to lek. Once suitably impregnated, usually by multiple males, the Reeve flies off onto the adjacent salt marsh to lay her four eggs in a small hollow, often within tussocks of long grasses/reeds. Incubation by the female alone takes around 21 days, but the young are entirely independent after one or two days, feeding up flightless and invisible in the tidal gullies and pools. Juvenile birds then appear on the fresh water pools and scrapes of Marshside, with up to 11 juvenile birds noted in July 2015.

    Up to 60 males and seven females attend the annual leks, which usually take place from the last 10 days of April into early May. By around the 10th May, the brief lekking season is all but over; the females have gone off onto the saltmarsh to lay eggs and the males are left to their own devices, occasionally indulging in desultory 'kick boxing' to pass the time

    2016 was an exception. The marshes did not start drying out until the end of May by which time many of the males had the opportunity to acquire their full nuptial plumage including complete ruffs and we were treated to some superb displays in early and mid-June. Our Ruffs usually acquire only partial-breeding plumage because their normal 'lekking' season starts early, in late April."

  name:  Turtle Dove
  latin: Streptopeplia turtur
  text:  "The rapid decline of the beautiful migrant dove began in the late 1970s and it's now extinct as a breeding bird in Lancashire and indeed throughout much of the UK. Since 2000 only two have been recorded; one on June 13th 2007 and the last on May 14th 2009. Maltese and other Mediterranean hunters have killed more than 2.5 million Turtle Doves per year since 1980 -- that's 90 million birds! The extermination of Europe's very own Passenger Pigeon continues unabated."
-
  name:  Cuckoo
  latin: Cuculus canorus
  text:  "With both of its favoured host species ReedWarbler and Meadow Pipit present in reasonable numbers, it is surprising there have been no recent breeding reports from on the reserve. Cuckoos are normally seen on spring passage between mid-April and early-May, depending on prevailing weather conditions. Never common, a good total would be of six individuals in the season and rarely more than one per day. They are even more difficult to connect with in autumn, with just the occasional juvenile reported every few years or so."
-
  name:  Barn Owl
  latin: Tyto alba
  text:  "A breeding pair is often resident in the water treatment plant at Crossens and birds are also occasionally seen in the vehicle sheds at HGC, but can never be depended upon. Post breeding dispersal can bring young birds to the reserve, but generally the Barn Owl retains its status as a occasional visitor to Marshside."
-
  name:  Little Owl
  latin: Athena noctua
  text:  "A scarce visitor with no records since a pair took up residence in an outbuilding at Stanley School in 2009/10."
-
  name:  Tawny Owl
  latin: Strix aluco
  text:  "Although resident in several nearby copses, the Tawny Owl is virtually never recorded. A pair are resident on the corner of Fleetwood Road and Hesketh Road and can be heard calling at dawn and dusk from HGC, where they are also very occasionally reported."
-
  name:  Long-eared Owl
  latin: Asio otus
  text:  "The only record is of a migrant, roosting in the bushes at the junction of Marshside Road and the Coast Road on September 13th 2006."
-
  name:  Short-eared Owl
  latin: Asio flammeus
  text:  "Up to the early 1990s, Short-eared Owls were a fairly regular visitor and up to six could regularly be seen quartering the saltmarsh. Ten metre plus spring tides still seem to attract two or three (local?) birds, as it's possible that one or two pairs may breed in the vicinity of Hundred End/Hesketh Out Marsh. There are also occasional records of presumed migrants in April/May."
-
  name:  Nightjar
  latin: Caprimulgus europaeus
  text:  "A very scarce breeding species in northwest England, with only a small population in south Cumbria and southern Scotland. Only three have ever been recorded, all pre-2000 and the last was of a bird calling at dawn on Hesketh Golf Course on May 16th 1999."
-
  name:  Common Swift
  latin: Apus apus
  text:  "Swifts are abundant visitors to the reserve, with small numbers breeding locally and large numbers on passage from the end of April until early June. The peak number counted in recent years is of 1,025 on May 15th 2012 and the average number of Swifts counted on spring passage in the peak VisMig coverage of spring 2012 and 2013 was 1,566 birds. The mean earliest arrival date for Lancashire is now April 20th, whereas pre-1990, very few Swifts arrived before early May. Odd plumaged birds in spring have included one with white under-parts, a black central chest stripe and a white rump and upper back in May 2012 and at least two birds in 2014 and 2015, or the same one returning, with a white rump. Autumn migration is much less obvious and by the end of August, nearly all will have departed for Africa. The mean latest sighting in Lancashire is October 7th"

  name:  Kingfisher
  latin: Alcedo atthis
  text:  "An uncommon but increasing visitor to the creeks and pools at Marshside, usually only recorded when flashing past Sandgrounders hide.They turn up in both winter and early spring but more commonly in August/September.

  name:  Great Spotted Woodpecker
  latin: Dendrocopus major
  text:  "At least one pair nests on HGC and/or in the large gardens in Fleetwood Drive. Small numbers have been recorded on MBO VisMig every year since 2012 -- earliest September 8th 2012 and the latest October 19th 2014, with two spring records on May 9th 2013 and April 19th 2014."
-
  name:  Kestrel
  latin: Falco tinnunculus
  text:  "Once the most numerous raptor frequenting Marshside, seeing a Kestrel hovering over Marshside nowadays is almost a noteworthy event. In the 1990s up to 30 birds could be seen hunting over the reserve and salt marshes in late August and September, but such numbers are now but a distant memory. Kestrels still breed locally on buildings, churches and in barns throughout the nearby mosslands, but have declined to a level below that in the mid-1960s."

  latin: Falco vespertinus
  text:  "An adult male on May 10th1979and an immature female on May 25th 1992 remain the only records."
-
  name:  Merlin
  latin: Falco columbarius
  text:  "A common winter visitor, with up to five 'resident' Merlins frequenting the reserve and salt marshes from the end August to early April. Since 2012, dawn VisMig sessions in late April/early May have produced three larger and darker female birds, approaching a male Peregrine in size. These are possibly of the _subaesalon_ population returning to Iceland, where 1,000 -2,000 pairs breed and only very few adult males overwinter."
-
  name:  Hobby
  latin: Falco subbuteo
  text:  "There were only nine documented records in _'Birds of Marshside '_ (BoM), 2000, Barry McCarthy, but since 2000numbers and sightings in Lancashire have increased. There are now at a minimum of six pairs of Hobbies nesting between the Ribble and the Mersey, and other pioneers have established territories as far north as the Spey valley in Scotland – so its not perhaps surprising that we are now recording these handsome, but elusive, falcons more frequently. The earliest sighting is of an adult on April 27th 2013 and the latest is of an obviously inexperienced juvenile on October 11th 2011, which only narrowly missed being killed by a car on the coast road."
-
  name:  Peregrine
  latin: Falco peregrinus
  text:  "Its BoM status as 'a common, almost daily visitor to the reserve, especially in winter' has not changed since 2000. There are at least two local eyries on man-made structures and suitable nesting sites are now at a premium. Prey species include virtually anything that flies, and even Pink-footed Geese are nervous if a large female peregrine 'waits on' over the saltmarshes, looking for a meal.."
-
  name:  Golden Oriole
  latin: Oriolus oriolus
  text:  "The long awaited first record of this beautiful species came on May 8th 2016, in a purple patch for migrants locally, which included Broad-billed Sandpiper and a fly through Pallid Harrier at Brockholes. Andy Pryce was the lucky individual and Hesketh Golf Course the location. Still to be ratified by the LRBC."

  name:  Jackdaw
  latin: Corvus monedula
  text:  "Locally common around Southport, up to 800 birds can be seen going to roost on the marine lake islands and the Hesketh estate in Churchtown on winter evenings. Feeding birds are very common on the reserve in the breeding season and occasionally presumed migrant flocks have been recorded on VisMig with the largest flock of 177 south at dawn on October 17th 2014."
-
  name:  Rook
  latin: Corvus frugilevus
  text:  "The recent (2011) re-establishment of the historic colony at Scarisbrick has resulted in many more sightings of Rooks on the nearby mosslands, inland of Marshside. They are still very rare visitors to the reserve itself and only ones and twos have been recorded on VisMig sessions in early March and early October."
-
  name:  Carrion Crow
  latin: Corvus corone
  text:  " An abundant and efficient predator of smaller birds, nestlings, eggs and small mammals, the Carrion Crow is usually to be seen all year round patrolling both the salt and fresh water marshes. Although its breeding status at Marshside is uncertain, it would be no surprise to find that two/three pairs are nesting on the edge of the reserve. Sizeable flocks (&gt;150) patrolling over the saltmarsh have been noted on April and October VisMig counts, but their origin and intention have been uncertain."
-
  name:  Hooded Crow
  latin: Corvus cornix
  text:  "Local birders who saw the bird in lateMarch/April 1990 or the one on October 18th 1998 can now add an immediate 'armchair tick' to their Marshside list. The only record since was of a bird on May 3rd 2012, which was only seen by a single observer."
-
  name:  Raven
  latin: Corvus corax
  text:  "A scarce visitor up to 2000, Ravens have become much more frequently recorded, often well out on the saltmarsh and especially on Crossens Outer Marsh.

-
  name:  Coal Tit
  latin: Periparus ater
  text:  "Although Coal Tits breed widely in pines in suburban Southport and the Sefton coastal pinewoods, there is no confirmation of breeding in the reserve recording area -- as yet. Small numbers have passed through on VizMig sessions since 2012, usually at the end of September or early October, but nothing like the flock of 28 on HGC on September 24th 1997."

-
  name:  Skylark
  latin: Alauda arvensis
  text:  "The uplifting, optimistic song of the Skylark can still be easily heard at Marshside, usually from the end of February, but in nothing like their former numbers. In the 1970s and 1980s, many hundreds of pairs nested, but in 2014 a mere 46 pairs were counted on the Breeding Birds Surveys with winter counts in the low hundreds instead of the many 1,000s as previously. Passage totals on two-hour dawn VisMig counts since 2012 have produced a maximum of 741 south on October 6th 2013 with most other late September/early October two-hour counts in the range of 150-400 birds. Peak spring passage takes place from the middle of February to the first week of March with a recent maximum of 156 birds in two hours north over MBO on February 27th 2014."
-
  name:  Shore Lark
  latin: Eremophila alpestris
  text:  "There have been four or five records of up to seven birds, but all pre-2000, with the last on February 24th 1999. Despite single birds being seen on the shoreline further south in Sefton in at least six recent winters, none have re-appeared at Marshside."

  name:  Sand Martin
  latin: Riparia riparia
  text:  "A common spring and autumn migrant, with a mean first arrival date in Lancashire of March 10th and a mean latest departure date is October 4th.

The peak VisMig two-hour count is of 91 on March 29th 2014."
-
  name:  Barn Swallow
  latin: Hirundo rustica
  text:  "An abundant spring and autumn passage migrant, with a mean first arrival date in the county of March 23rd. and a mean latest departure of November 23rd. Peak passage is from the last two weeks of April until May 10 and the peak two-hour VisMig count is an outstanding 1,048 on May 1st 2012 – a day of clearing weather and fresh NE winds when migration appeared to continue for most of the morning. A two-hour afternoon count in clearing weather and a light NW wind on May 6th 2013 produced a total of 533 birds. Red-breasted birds were recorded on May 19th – 21st 2013 and another, less rufous individual, not considered the same bird, was seen on May 20th 2016. Up to three pairs usually nest under the eaves of the Sandgrounders hide and formerly in the derelict building on MBO (aka the Old Sand Plant compound)."

A regular colony of &gt;30 pairs is present on the housing estate next to the boundary of the reserve and take full advantage of the ample supplies of nest building materials, mud and flying insects."
-
  name:  Cetti's Warbler
  latin: Cettia cetti
  text:  "This long awaited species has slowly expanded along the western seaboard of the UK over the past 35 years. For some reason it appeared to have jumped across Liverpool Bay and the Ribble, to set up at Marton Mere, not 10Km as the crow flies from Marshside. The distinctive Blackbird-like rattling contact call was first heard from the SSSI ditch/reed bed on March 11th 2015 and was heard but not seen on several occasions thereafter. Another was glimpsed on the banks of Sutton's Marsh on April 23rd the same year."
-
  name:  Long-tailed Tit
  latin: Aegithalos caudatus

  name:  Yellow-browed Warbler
  latin: Phylloscopus inornatus
  text:  "The first record of this scarce but increasing migrant from Siberia was on HGC on September 29th 1997. Further records of single birds, usually first located by their distinctive calls are:- October 3rd 2003 by Sandgrounder's Hide, October 4th 2012 at Marshside Bird Observatory and October 6 th 2012 on HGC, probably the same bird, and again on HGC on September 29th2014. One was noted on November 3rd 2015. A huge influx occurred in the UK in the almost continual easterly airflow of late September/ mid October 2016 and at least two were seen/heard in the period October 5th-15th 2016."
-
  name:  Wood Warbler
  latin: Phylloscopus sibilatrix
  text:  "A scarce spring passage migrant, usually in the first weeks of May and invariably singing from the central copse on HGC.

The mean first arrival date for Lancashire is April 23rd."
-
  name:  Chiffchaff
  latin: Phylloscopus collybita
  text:  "The first of the warblers to return in spring, the welcome but repetitive song of the Chiffchaff is usually heard from early March, However, as increasing numbers are now overwintering, it's becoming more difficult to differentiate which have just arrived. Five pairs bred on HGC in 2014."
-
  name:  Willow Warbler
  latin: Phylloscopus trochilus
  text:  "A common spring and autumn migrant with a mean first arrival date in Lancashire of March 29th. Until the early 2000s, between four to six pairs nested on HGC each year, but in recent years they have disappeared to be replaced by Chiffchaffs, as appears to be the case from many other lowland sites.. 'Falls' of migrant sometimes occur, such as April 23rd 2014 when 39 were counted on HGC."
-
  name:  Blackcap
  latin: Sylvia atricapilla
  text:  "An abundant migrant and common breeding species, with increasing numbers over-wintering. As with the Chiffchaff, it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate true migrants from winter visitors as the melodious song of the 'Northern Nightingale' can now be heard from early March onwards. At least eight males were on territory on HGC in 2015."
-
  name:  Garden Warbler
  latin: Sylvia borin
  text:  "In the early 1990s up to three pairs nested on HGC, but since 2000, it has reverted to its former status as an uncommon spring migrant.

-
  name:  Common Whitethroat
  latin: Sylvia cantillans
  text:  "Our commonest breeding warbler, the Whitethroat increased steadily throughout the 1990s, so that by 2004 a record 38 pairs were noted throughout the reserve. In 2015 this had reduced to 28 pairs, possibly due to on-going scrub management to encourage the populations of small mammals. The mean first arrival date in Lancashire is April 15th."
-
  name:  Grasshopper Warbler
  latin: Locustella naevia
  text:  "'Groppers' are secretive and would hardly ever be recorded, if it wasn't for the distinctive 'reeeeeeling' song of the male, deep within the brambles and overgrown edges. Their mean first arrival date is April 15th and in some years several birds can be heard around the reserve. In 2016 males sang for over a month or more below the bench at Wheatear Corner and from near the viewing screen at Junction Pool."

In the early 1990s the breeding population had increased to 27 pairs, but by 2014 this had reduced to 18 pairs, again perhaps due to recent scrub management (see Whitethroat). In 2014, an almost pure white _leucistic_ male took up territory by Marshside Road"

Pre-2000, substantial falls were reported with for example, 44 on May 9th 1982, 31 on May 11th 1992 and 22 on May 6th 1997. . These days, in line with the overall decline in numbers, peak passage in early May seldom produces totals of more than ten birds, with a recent maximum of nine on May 9th 2016. Autumn passage is virtually non-existent with just two records in the last 16 years."

  name:  Stonechat
  latin: Saxicola rubicola
  text:  "Following a drastic decline in the late 1980s/early 1990s and recent setbacks due to severe winter weather in 2010/12, it's good to record the current recovery in numbers of both migrant and breeding Stonechats. Until the mid-1980s, one or two pairs bred on what is now the reserve, with a pair also present in 2006, but breeding has not been confirmed since. Dawn VisMig sessions between 2012 and 2016 averaged 10 birds per year in the period February 27th and April 18th. Up to four birds can be seen around the reserve in most winters, especially along the edge of the saltmarsh."

  name:  Wheatear
  latin: Oenanthe oenanthe
  text:  "A common, sometimes abundantspring migrant with much smaller numbers recorded in autumn. The mean earliest arrival date for Lancashire is March 10th, with 100 plus recorded on April 23rd 1980; this was at a time when &gt; 40 birds per day was not exceptional. More recent VisMig counts have produced average totals of 196 between April 26th – 17th May 2012 and 186 between April 12th- June 2nd 2013 and a maximum day total of 63 on April 30th 2012. Most of the migrants from early-May are of the larger Greenland (and Iceland) race _leucorhoa._ Autumn passage is much less obvious and the latest everrecorded was one at MBO on November 22nd 2013. A pair attempted to breed in a rabbit hole at the Sand Plant in 1993 but was unsuccessful."

  name:  Dunnock
  latin: Prunella modularis
  text:  "A fairly common breeding resident with occasional influxes in autumn/winter. 13 singing males were counted around the reserve on April 16th 2016, eight on HGC and the rest along the coastal road, MBO and Crossens."
-
  name:  House Sparrow
  latin: Passer domesticus
  text:  "Breeds in the housing estates on the edge of Sutton's marsh and often feeds on the reserve. Has also colonised the bushes and shrubbery on the edge of the coastal road and Marshside Road. A noisy flock of 98 was counted in the long hedgerow adjacent to Stanley School playing fields on September 8th 2012."
-
  name:  Tree Sparrow
  latin: Passer montanus
  text:  " Until 1986, this threatened species was commonly seen along the coastal road embankment and near Crossens Water treatment works. The current situation suggests some stabilisation in the breeding population, helped by both nesting box and winter feeding initiatives, Small numbers have been noted on spring VisMigs, two north on May 15th 2013, a single on 10th April 2015, two on May 10th the same year and four in the MBO bushes on October 5th 2016."
-
  name:  Yellow Wagtail
  latin: Motacilla flava flavissima
  text:  "Believe it or not Marshside once witnessed an amazing fall of 300 stunning Yellow Wagtails, but that was 38 years ago on May 3rd 1978. A catastrophic decline had set in by the mid-1980s and nowadays spring migrant numbers remain very low. The mean earliest arrival date in Lancashire is April 10th and VisMig counts from 2012 to 2016 have barely exceeded 10 in a period extending from mid-April to early June, with a peak of 19 in spring 2013. One or two pairs still nest on the nearby mosslands and a Blue-headed male _flava_ is reported every few years. Autumn passage is almost non-existent."
-
  name:  Grey Wagtail
  latin: Motacilla cinerea
  text:  " A regular autumn migrant in small numbers between late September and mid-October and an uncommon, early spring, migrant between mid-March and early April. The peak count on autumn VisMig is of 24 individuals between September 22nd and October 27th 2012. It now regularly breeds in central Southport, with at least three pairs in 2016 and winter roosts contain &gt; 20 birds"
-
  name:  Pied/White Wagtail
  latin: Motacilla alba yarelli/alba
  text:  "A breeding survey of the recording area on April 16th 2016, found five pairs of Pied Wagtails, probably around the average number. Migrants return from late February and pass through until the end of April, with the highest VisMig count at MBO of 24 on March 31st 2014. Autumn passage is less pronounced and lasts from mid October to early November. The distinctive, nominate race alba breeds on Iceland and is perhaps more common on spring and autumn migration than _yarelli._ They pass through slightly later on spring migration and often in larger flocks, for example 53 on April 21st and 62 on April 27th 2013. In autumn mixed flocks occur and counts are usually only made of _alba_ sp. counts in October are the range of 20-40 per VisMig."
-
  name:  Richard's Pipit
  latin: Anthus richardii
  text:  "One was within the former sand plant compound on January 16th 1995 and another at the same location from October 29th the same year. Since then, one frequented Crossens Outer between October 19th and 22nd 2003."
-
  name:  Tree Pipit
  latin: Anthus trivialis
  text:  "This classic spring migrant is regular invariable numbers and the mean first arrival date in Lancashire is April 5th. Arrivals at Marshside are concentrated in the period mid April-mid May, with a peak day VisMig total of 12 on May 3rd 2013. The earliest ever was one on March 28th 1997 and the latest September 29th 1995."
-
  name:  Meadow Pipit
  latin: Anthus pratensis
  text:  "Although declining nationally as a breeding species, Marshside still hosted 24 pairs in 2014, but it's as the 'default' abundant migrant that Mipits are better known to VisMig afficionados. Large movements occur on a regular basis such as on March 29th/30th 2014, when some 973 and 625 headed north respectively, during a two-hour dawn watch and a combined total of 2,130 for spring passage that year. Autumn passage can also be impressive with for example 625 south in two hours on September 22nd and 466 on September 27th 2015. Occasionally weather conditions and the timing of movements combine to produce quite extraordinary numbers, such as the estimated 1,500 per hour passing southeast on a broad front in light easterly winds, from dawn on Saturday, October 1st 2011; a movement which was reported as lasting much of the day, albeit in reducing numbers. As up to a million pairs breed in Iceland it's perhaps not too surprising that good numbers of migrant Mipits are seen at Marshside"

  name:  Red-throated Pipit
  latin: Anthus cervinus
  text:  "The first record of this Fenno-Scandinavian pipit, was of one seen flying over the old sand plant compound on November 1st 1995. The second was seen and heard over the coast road on October 20th 2009."
-
  name:  Rock Pipit
  latin: Anthus petrosus
  text:  "Studies have shown that Rock Pipits of the nominate British race _petrosus_ are almoat entirely sedentary all year on their favoured rocky shorelines, of which Lancashire has almost none – although surely young birds must be moved on by their parents post-breeding? This leaves the highly migratory Scandinavian race _littoralis_ to overwinter on our salt marshes. To add to the debate, in spring some assume a breeding plumage, which very closely resembles that of the continental Water Pipit _Anthus spinoletta._ Rock Pipits are not often seen in winter and are usually only observed when the high spring tides flood the salt marshes, pushing them into viewing range."
-
  name:  Water Pipit
  latin: Anthus spinoletta
  text:  "Only split from Rock Pipit in 1986, the status of this central European, high-altitude specialist wintering on the Ribble saltmarshes, has been the subject of considerable debate. Records have been fairly regular from the area of Crossens Water Treatment plant since the late 1970s and new identification criteria has enabled several local wintering sites to be closely monitored. Warton Bank, on the north shore of the Ribble Estuary, was found to have an amazing 19 Water Pipits on March 30th 1998, but Marshside too has shared in this bounty over the years with three present on November 27th 2011 and in subsequent years. From late February to early May 2016, up to four Water Pipits were again wintering on Crossens Out Marsh."
-
  name:  Brambling
  latin: Fringilla montifringilla
  text:  "Now an uncommon passage migrant and winter visitor. Up to the late 1980s Bramblings were fairly regular winter visitors, but by 2000 had become very scarce. Dawn VisMig between October 2011 and the end of 2015 produced the grand total of one bird on November 10th 2012. The earliest autumn arrival in Lancashire was of one recorded at Marshside on September 13th 1999."
-
  name:  Chaffinch
  latin: Fringilla coelebs
  text:  "A common regular breeding resident, with around eight pairs in 2015, most on HGC. Autumn VisMig sees migrants pass through in small flocks between early September and early November with a maximum count in recent years of 25 on October 5th 2014."
-
  name:  Bullfinch
  latin: Pyrrhula pyrrhula
  text:  " A very scarce late autumn migrant and winter visitor and several years can go by without any records at all. Only four recorded pre-2000, with only three singles recorded during VisMig counts on October 6th 2013; October 11th 2012 and February 16th 2013."
-
  name:  Greenfinch
  latin: Carduelis chloris
  text:  "Much more regular than Chaffinch on two hours dawn VisMig. 2013 was seemingly a good year for Greenfinch passage with 203 counted from September 4th–October 13th and a peak on the last date of 107. However, on September 27th 2015, some 272 flew south in just two hours, the peak total on recent VisMig watches. Spring passage from mid April – mid May is much more muted, with only one/two birds noted. Two males held territory in spring 2016."
-
  name:  Linnet
  latin: Linaria cannabina
  text:  "A fairly common year-round resident and passage migrant in both spring and autumn. A total of 21 pairs bred in 2014, which is a great improvement on the five pairs that bred in 1999. During spring passage in 2013, 182 were counted between April 6th and May 10th with peaks of 37 on April 21st, 36 on April 2nd and 30 on April 25th. Autumn numbers are much lower with just small flocks recorded."
-
  name:  Twite
  latin: Linaria flavirostris
  text:  "Currently up to 100 birds winter just north of Southport Pier ranging as far south as Weld Road. However, on the reserve itself they are decidedly scarce and have been so since the mid 1990s, when flocks of around 50 were regular. Occasional birds still turn up at MBO, such as 82 on the old sand road on February 16th 2014, probably the pier flock, and six that flew over north at dawn during a two-hour Vismig watch on March 6th the same year. A flock of 108, probably the regular Pier flock, flew over high south on September 27th 2015."
-
  name:  Lesser Redpoll
  latin: Acanthis cabaret
  text:  "Formerly bred on HGC from the mid 1980s until at least 1992, when a record 12 pairs nested. This localised breeding population then declined to zero by 1999. It's also regular spring migrant with small parties passing over between mid-March and mid-May. 2012 was a particularly good year with 217 recorded and a peak of 55 on both May 1st and 3rd 2012. Only very few are recorded on return migration in October and November."
-
  name:  Common (Mealy) Redpoll
  latin: Acanthis flammea
  text:  "Not split from Lesser Redpoll until 2005, recent ringing studies show they apparently do occur with Lessers, but in a ratio of c.1:150. There are only five records of seven birds :- the first on April 12th plus two on May 7th 2006; a male singing on HGC on May 6th 2008 plus two on November 6th 2011."
-
  name:  Common Crossbill
  latin: Loxia curvirostra
  text:  "Despite regular flocks in the Birkdale pinewoods, Crossbills are extremely rare visitors to Marshside. The first record was on April 5th 2003 when five briefly landed in trees by the central copse on HGC, The only other records are of one north with a rush of migrants on May 1st 2012 and two south on Oct 7th the same year. Two were flushed from the central copse on HGC on October 8th 2016."
-
  name:  Goldfinch
  latin: Carduelis carduelis
  text:  "15 singing males were counted throughout the reserve on May 12th 2016, although the old sea wall along the NE edge of the reserve was not covered. The Goldfinch has expanded its range northwards into Scotland since 2000 and recent population estimates there, exceed 20,000 pairs. Accordingly it has become a much more regular passage migrant, particularly in spring. Birds have been recorded on active VisMig from mid-February to the end of May and from early September to the end of October. In spring 2012 no less than 1,811 Goldfinches passed over MBO, with a peak of 707 in three hours from dawn on May 1st. Autumn totals are also significant, with for example 897 counted in 2012 and a two-hour peak of 212 on September 22nd 2013."

  name:  Siskin
  latin: Spinus spinus
  text:  "A common passage spring passage migrant with 154 counted between April 24th and May 18 2014 and a peak of 92 on May 3rd. Small numbers appear on return migration between end September and early November, with the largest flock of 34 on November 2nd 2012."
-
  name:  Snow Bunting
  latin: Plectrophenax nivalis
  text:  "Up to the 1980s, small flocks regularly wintered at Marshside, but by 2000 had all but disappeared. The most recent record is of a single bird, which flew over MBO calling on November 16th 2011."

  name:  Yellowhammer
  latin: Emberiza citronella
  text:  "Always a scarce visitor recent population declines has made it even more so. Three different individuals on spring passage in late April/early May 2012 are the only recent records."
-
  name:  Reed Bunting
  latin: Emberiza schoeniclus
  text:  "With nine pairs nesting in 2015, the simple but persistent song of the male Reed Bunting is usually heard from the edges of the saltmarsh from mid-March onwards. They are also regularly recorded on autumn VisMig counts between end-September and end-October, with a maximum count of 17 on October 17th 2014. Very few, if any, over-winter on the reserve itself."
-
  name:  Corn Bunting
  latin: Emberiza calandra
  text:  "Another depressing tale of a declining farmland bird, which used to winter in reasonable numbers on the saltmarsh. By 2000 they had almost disappeared with perhaps the odd pair still nesting on the edge of Crossens Outer saltmarsh. Recorded recently on VisMig with one amongst other migrants at MBO on March 30th 2014."
