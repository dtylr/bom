# BIRDS of MARSHSIDE 2

## John K Bannon

This annotated checklist adds to and updates the status of the 257 BOU Category A, B & C species, which have been recorded within and/or from the recording area of Marshside RSPB Reserve, as of October 11th 2016.

All but six of the species are British Ornithological Union (BOU) Category A, (that is recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since January 1st 1950). The exceptions are Harlequin Duck and Great Snipe, which are BOU Category B (recorded at least once in an apparently natural state between January 1st 1800 and December 31st 1949, but not recorded subsequently).

Greylag Goose, Ruddy Duck, Red-legged Partridge and Feral Pigeon are all Category C species, which although originally introduced by man, currently derive from subsequent self-sustaining populations.

The only BOU Category D species, Ross's Goose, is a species which would have appeared in Category A, except that there is reasonable doubt that it has have ever occurred in a natural state in the UK and as such is not counted in the above total. Category E species—introductions, human-assisted transportations or escapees from captivity—are also not included, perhaps the most notable of which were a pair of Harris Hawks that nested just off the reserve at Banks.

Records highlighted in yellow have not been included in the current species total and only those records fully accepted by the Lancashire Birds Records Committee (LBRC) or the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC) are included in the total of 257.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Without constant reference to the invaluable *Birds of Marshside*, Barry McCarthy, Hobby Publications, 2001; the annual *Lancashire Bird Reports* 2000—2015 and the superb *Birds of Lancashire & North Merseyside*, Hobby Publications, 2005, I could never have even attempted this updated checklist and any errors contained within are entirely mine.

My grateful thanks also go to those who regularly post their sightings on the Ribble Estuary Facebook Page. Thanks also to those knowledgeable fellow birders who have reviewed and commented on this updated checklist – you know who you are…
